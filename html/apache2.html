        <h1>Don't Be Like Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm rage. I'm a teenager who works with tech and code stuff in C++ etc, even though I'm majoring in Bio haha. I'm not here to talk about that though. I'm here to talk about something.</p>
        <p><strong>Don't be like me.</strong></p>
        <p>By this, I mean in terms of morals. When I was 7-8 years old, my dad beat my mom and he went to jail for 2 weeks. Once we got back to our home country, he divorced my mom. Even though he is rich and can afford things easily, he is miser and doesn't pay child support.</p>
        <p>My mom did not have a good childhood (according to my father, this isn't verified). I believe she takes out her anger on me, and says mean things to me. Things like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"You shouldn't have been born."</li>
            <li>"You're just like your father."</li>
            <li>"I did this all for you, but you give me nothing in return."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this period, I was... suicidal. I tried 6 times now. I wanted to jump off the roof. Choke myself. Many things. They all failed.</p>
        <p>I never wanted to be born too. Why me? What did I do? Why is it my fault? I didn't even have a fucking childhood.</p>
        <p>Then, I found it. Somewhere other people are. A lot of them, and diverse. Social media.</p>
        <p>More specifically, it was Discord. I would learn how to code and help people with other things. I would spend day and night helping. Since I'm Asian (lol), I don't really have to study. So I spent more time helping people. You know what I got?</p>
        <p><strong>Praise.</strong></p>
        <p>It was like a drug. I got addicted. I needed it all the time. My parents never gave it to me. I always expected it from those who I helped.</p>
        <p>Once, I helped someone for over a year. He was a close friend on Discord. It was programming related. I'll spare you the details though, because in the end, I was betrayed and he threw me away like I was nothing. I was there since Day 1. Since the start. I supported him against everyone. And the person who was hurt was me. All over again, it happened.</p>
        <p>I cried for days. Why? Why me? Again?</p>
        <p>If he's reading this, he will probably laugh. It doesn't really affect me though, since I was made fun of my whole life.</p>
        <p>Alas, if you're dependent on praise, if you expect something, if you're too humble, <strong>you. Will. Be. Betrayed.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Don't be like me.</strong></p>
        <p>Don't try killing yourself.</p>
        <p>Ignore any negative things people say.</p>
        <p>Even if those people, are your parents.</p>
        <p>Talk to someone if you feel like killing yourself. If you can't, talk to me. You know from where. You'll see it on my GitHub description on my username (<strong>Ragekill3377</strong>).</p>
        <p>That's all. I ended up like this, programming, to make money online myself. I don't want to be dependent. I will never expect anything. Remember, don't thrive on praise. Don't prove anything to anyone.</p>
        <p><strong>It's ok to say NO.</strong></p>
        <p>:)</p>
